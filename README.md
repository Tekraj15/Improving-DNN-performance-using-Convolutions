# Object-Detection-with-Amazon-Sagemaker
Train and deploy an object detector using Amazon Sagemaker. 
Sagemaker provides a number of machine learning algorithms ready to be used for solving a number of tasks. We will use the SSD Object Detection algorithm from Sagemaker to create, train and deploy a model that will be able to localize faces of dogs and cats from the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.
